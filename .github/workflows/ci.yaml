  # Some coverage goals of these tests:
  # - Test once without Rails at all
  # - Test postgres, to make sure that the ActiveRecord
  #   stuff works on that (as well as the default sqlite)
  # - Test mongoid -- and several versions, since they're quite different
  # - Run the tests with Rails _and_ TESTING_LEGACY=1 to test legacy codepaths
  # - Run the JS unit tests once
  # - Test each major version of Rails we support
  # - Test the min/max minor Ruby version we support (and others?)
